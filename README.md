# A Course in Miracles App

A Course in Miracles App


## How / Why
On the evening of Tue 20 Dec 2022 I listened to the following Audio Book : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_L9EW95xcA 

The next day I decided I wanted to do this "Course in Miracles" and I hunted around and managed to find the text, and also resources of the actual course,
I found that it is an actual 365 day course that you do, and the daily activites seem pretty simple.

I'm making some big life changes next year anyway, which include being off social media and media generally, 
but I do want to still have some content that I do put in my brain, and this seemed like a good fit.
I made this facebook post to see if friends would do it with me: https://www.facebook.com/kris.randall/posts/pfbid0278f6RBoBCJRZgmMMjxLFv5TM9ts1qJzqHgvTrTsa5pAsLvWrSVZmtjnafBSQFPqGl
But then I thought it would be really good if there was an actual app.    
**This is that app.**

## App Content

The menu of the app will be as follows:

  Each day, for 1 year, do a single lesson, ideally first thing in the morning, then mark it as done.

2.. ... all the lessons ...

## Permissions 

I'm not affiliated with ACIM at the time of writing this, nor do I have permission to have scraped the data from their site and turned it into an app.  But I hope that I shall - and I'll reach out to them as soon as I finish making it.
In fact I've just found [this page](https://acim.org/fip/terms-of-service/copyright-permissions-policy/), which says to reach out to them for permission before printing anything - so I will do that before putting the app into the stores (but after publishing this github and an APK so they can see it in action).

.. also, I didn't actually think to check the app store to see if there was already a Course in Miracles app (there is) until I was almost done.
