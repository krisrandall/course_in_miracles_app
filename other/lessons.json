more than in the preceding ones, you may find it hard to be indiscriminate, and to avoid giving greater weight to some subjects than to others.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#4:2\"><span

class=\"snr\">2</span>If this occurs, think first of this:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"407#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I cannot keep this form of upset and let the others go.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For the purposes of these exercises, then, I will regard them all as the same.</span></p></div> <div

or so, and try to identify a number of different forms of upset that are disturbing you, regardless of the relative importance you may give them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"407#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Apply the idea for today to each of them, using the name of both the source of the upset as you perceive it, and of the feeling as you experience it.</span> <span

doing this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"468#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Then tell yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"468#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>On

repeating.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is a central idea in your new thought system, and the perception that it produces.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The miracle is always there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Its presence is not caused by your vision; its absence is not the result of your failure to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#1:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>It is only your awareness of miracles that is affected.</span> <span

<span data-sentence-id=\"495#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>This follows from the premises from which the darkness comes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Denial of light leads to failure to perceive it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Failure to perceive light is to perceive darkness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The light is useless to you then, even though it is there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#2:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>You cannot use it because its presence is unknown to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#2:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>And the seeming reality of the darkness makes the idea of light

that what you do not see is there sounds like insanity.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is very difficult to become convinced that it is insanity not to see what is there, and to see what is not there instead.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You do not doubt that the body’s eyes can see.</span> <span

the darkness, not the light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>How can this be reversed?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#3:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>For

strength, your doubts would vanish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Today we will devote ourselves to the attempt to let you feel this strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When you have felt the strength in you, which makes all miracles within your easy reach, you will not doubt.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The miracles your sense of weakness hides will leap into awareness as you feel the strength in you.</span></p></div> <div

for a quiet time in which you try to leave your weakness behind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>This is accomplished very simply, as you instruct yourself that you are not a body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Faith goes to what you want, and you instruct your mind accordingly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Your will remains your teacher, and your will has all the strength to do what it desires.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#5:5\"><span

<span data-sentence-id=\"495#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What am I?</span></p> <p class=\"p-normal\"><span data-sentence-id=\"495#6:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>The question with which this statement ends is needed for our exercises today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What you think you are is a belief to be undone.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#6:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>But what you really are must be revealed to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#6:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>The belief you are a body calls for correction, being a mistake.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#6:10\"><span class=\"snr\">10</span>The truth of what you are calls on the strength in you to bring to your awareness what the mistake conceals.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"495#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#7:1\"><span class=\"snr

body in your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You need to feel something to put your faith in, as you lift it from the body.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You need a real experience of something else, something more solid and more sure; more worthy of your faith, and really there.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"495#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you are not a body, what are you?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Ask this in honesty, and then devote several minutes to allowing your mistaken thoughts about your attributes to be corrected, and their opposites to take their place.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Say, for example:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"495#8:4\"><span

<span data-sentence-id=\"495#8:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>I am not an illusion, but a reality.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#8:9\"><span class=\"snr\">9</span>I cannot see in darkness, but

phase of the exercise period, try to experience these truths about yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Concentrate particularly on the experience of strength.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Remember that all sense of weakness is associated with the belief you are a body, a belief that is mistaken and deserves no faith.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Try to remove your faith from it, if only for a moment.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You will be accustomed to keeping faith with the more worthy in you as we go along.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"495#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span

supported by the strength of God and all His Thoughts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is from Them that your strength will come.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is through Their strong support that you will feel the strength in you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>They are united with you in this practice period, in which you share a purpose like Their Own.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Theirs is the light in which you will see miracles, because Their strength is yours.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Their strength becomes your eyes, that you may see.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"495#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Five or six times an hour, at reasonably regular intervals, remind yourself that miracles are seen in light.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Also, be sure to meet temptation with today’s idea.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"495#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>This form would be helpful for this special purpose:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span

darkness in terms of weakness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>That is because your idea of what seeing means is tied up with the body and its eyes and brain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"496#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Thus you believe that you can change what you see by putting little bits of glass before your eyes.</span> <span

<span data-sentence-id=\"537#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Others find it in experience that is not of this world, which shows them that the world does not exist because what they behold must be

it was by merely changing all the thoughts that gave it these appearances.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"537#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The sick are healed as you let go all thoughts of

purpose has no meaning.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Being causeless and without a meaningful intent of any kind, it cannot be at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When this is seen, healing is automatic.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It dispels this meaningless illusion by the same approach that carries all of them to truth, and merely leaves them there to disappear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Sickness is not an accident.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Like all defenses, it is an insane device for self-deception.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And like all the rest, its purpose is to hide reality, attack it, change it, render it inept, distort it, twist it, or reduce it to a little pile of unassembled parts.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The aim of all defenses is to keep the truth from being whole.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The parts are seen as if each one were whole within itself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Defenses are not unintentional, nor are they made without awareness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>They are secret, magic wands you wave when truth appears to threaten what you would believe.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>They seem to be unconscious but because of the rapidity with which you choose to use them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>In that second, even less, in which the choice is made, you recognize exactly what you would attempt to do, and then proceed to think that it is done.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Who but yourself evaluates a threat, decides escape is necessary, and sets up a series of defenses to reduce the threat that has been judged as real?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>All this cannot be done unconsciously.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>But afterwards, your plan requires that you must forget you made it, so it seems to be external to your own intent; a happening beyond your state of mind, an outcome with a real effect on you, instead of one effected by yourself.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is this quick forgetting of the part you play in making your “reality” that makes defenses seem to be beyond your own control.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>But what you have forgot can be remembered, given willingness to reconsider the decision which is doubly shielded by oblivion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Your not remembering is but the sign that this decision still remains in force, as far as your desires are concerned.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Mistake not this for fact.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Defenses must make facts unrecognizable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>They aim at doing this, and it is this they do.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Every defense takes fragments of the whole, assembles them without regard to all their true relationships, and thus constructs illusions of a whole that is not there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It is this process that imposes threat, and not whatever outcome may result.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When parts are wrested from the whole and seen as separate and wholes within themselves, they become symbols standing for attack upon the whole; successful in effect, and never to be seen as whole again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And yet you have forgotten that they stand but for your own decision of what should be real, to take the place of what is real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span

thing that happens to you, quite unsought, which makes you weak and brings you suffering.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is a choice you make, a plan you lay, when for an instant truth arises in your own deluded mind, and all your world appears to totter and prepare to fall.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Now are you sick, that truth may go away and threaten your establishments no more.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span

class=\"snr\">2</span>Because it proves the body is not separate from you, and so you must be separate from the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You suffer pain because the body does, and in this pain are you made one with it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Thus is your “true” identity preserved, and the strange, haunting thought that you might be something beyond this little pile of dust silenced and stilled.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For see, this dust can make you suffer, twist your limbs and stop your heart, commanding you to die and cease to be.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Thus is the body stronger than the truth, which asks you live, but cannot overcome your choice to die.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And so the body is more powerful than everlasting life, Heaven more frail than hell, and God’s design for the salvation of His Son opposed by a decision stronger than His Will.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>His Son is dust, the Father incomplete, and chaos sits in triumph on His throne.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Such is your planning for your own defense.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And you believe that Heaven quails before such mad attacks as these, with God made blind by your illusions, truth turned into lies, and all the universe made slave to laws which your defenses would impose on it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet who believes illusions but the one

to think you die, or suffer sickness or distort the truth in any way.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>What is created is apart from all of this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Defenses are plans to defeat what cannot be attacked.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#11:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What is

and futile your attempts to plan defenses that would alter it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Truth merely wants to give you happiness, for such its purpose is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Perhaps it sighs a little when you throw away its gifts, and yet it knows, with perfect certainty, that what God wills for you must be received.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#13\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">13.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#13:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It is this fact that demonstrates that time is an illusion.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#13:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For time lets you think what God has given you is not the truth right now, as it must be.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The Thoughts of God are quite apart from time.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For time is but another meaningless defense you made against the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#13:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Yet what He wills is here, and you

comes to any mind that would lay down its arms, and cease to play with folly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#14:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is found at any time; today, if you will choose

free.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#15:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And truth will come, for it has never been apart from us.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#15:4\"><span

the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#15:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>I will accept the truth of what I am, and let my mind be wholly healed today.</span></p></div> <div

peace and truth arise to take the place of war and vain imaginings.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#16:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>There will be no dark corners sickness can conceal, and keep defended from the light of truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#16:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>There will be no dim figures from your dreams, nor their obscure and meaningless pursuits with double purposes insanely sought, remaining in your mind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#16:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It will be healed of all the sickly wishes that it tried to authorize the body to obey.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#17\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">17.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#17:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now is the body healed, because the source of sickness has been opened to relief.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#17:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And you will recognize you practiced well by this: The body should not feel at all.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#17:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>If you have been successful, there will be no sense of feeling ill or feeling well, of pain or pleasure.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#17:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>No response at all is in the mind to what the body does.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#17:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Its usefulness remains and nothing more.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#18\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">18.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#18:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perhaps you do not realize that this removes the limits you had placed upon the body by the purposes you gave to it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#18:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>As these are laid aside, the strength the body has will always be enough to serve all truly useful purposes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#18:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The body’s health is fully guaranteed, because it is not limited by time, by weather or fatigue, by food and drink, or any laws you made it serve before.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#18:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You need do nothing now to make it well, for sickness has become impossible.</span></p></div> <div

careful watching.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#19:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If you let your mind harbor attack thoughts, yield to judgment or make plans against uncertainties to come, you have again misplaced yourself, and made a bodily identity which will attack the body, for the mind is sick.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"541#20\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span

<span data-sentence-id=\"541#20:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Do not be confused about what must be healed, but tell yourself:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"541#20:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>I have forgotten what I really am, for I mistook my body for myself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#20:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Sickness is a defense against the truth.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"541#20:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But I am not a body.</span> <span

<span data-sentence-id=\"542#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In sickness must he be apart and separate.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But healing is his own decision to be one again, and to accept his Self with all Its parts intact and unassailed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#3:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>In sickness does his Self appear to be dismembered, and without the unity that gives It life.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#3:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>But healing is accomplished as he sees the body has no power to attack the

accustomed to illusions must be shown that what they look upon is false.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#4:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>So healing, never needed by the truth, must demonstrate

seen to disappear in spite of all the laws that hold it cannot but be real, then questions have been answered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"542#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And the laws can be

your resurrection, for your life is not a part of anything you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It stands beyond the body and the world, past every witness for unholiness, within the Holy, holy as Itself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>In everyone and everything His Voice would speak to you of nothing but your Self and your Creator, Who is one with Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>So will you see the holy face of Christ in everything, and hear in everything no sound

with but a single, slow repeating of the thought with which the day begins.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#13:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And then we watch our thoughts, appealing silently to Him Who sees the elements of truth in them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"557#13:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Let Him evaluate each thought that comes to mind, remove the elements of dreams, and

on everything as one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It sees instead but fragments of the whole, for only thus could it invent the partial world you see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The purpose of all seeing is to show you what you wish to see.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>All

them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Yet He can use but what we made, to teach us from a different point of view, so we can see a different use in

to be but empty sounds; pretty, perhaps, correct in sentiment, yet fundamentally not understood nor understandable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#4:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>The mind that taught itself to think specifically can no longer grasp abstraction in the sense that it is all-encompassing.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#4:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>We need to see a

bodies are but symbols for a concrete form of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Fear without symbols calls for no response, for symbols can stand for the meaningless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Love needs no symbols, being true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>But fear

what but mind directs the body to attack?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#6:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>What else could be the seat of fear except what thinks of fear?</span></p></div> <div

a form he can be touched and seen and heard, and ultimately killed.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#7:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>When hatred rests upon a thing, it calls for death as surely as God’s Voice proclaims there is no death.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#7:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Fear is insatiable, consuming everything its eyes behold, seeing itself in everything, compelled to turn upon itself and to destroy.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"567#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#8:1\"><span class=\"snr

fear external to himself, poised to attack, and howling to unite with him again.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Mistake not the intensity of rage projected fear must spawn.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"567#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It shrieks in wrath, and claws the air in frantic hope it can reach to its maker and devour him.</span></p></div> <div

data-sentence-id=\"576#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>When you think that you attack in self-defense, you mean that to be cruel is protection; you are safe because of cruelty.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You mean that you believe to hurt another brings you freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#1:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And you mean that to attack is to exchange the state in which you are for something better, safer, more secure from dangerous invasion and from fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>How thoroughly insane is the idea that to defend from fear is to attack!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For here is fear begot and fed with blood, to make it grow and swell and rage.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And thus is fear protected, not escaped.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Today we learn a lesson which can save you more delay and needless misery than you can possibly imagine.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#2:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is this:</span></p> <p class=\"p-prayer\"><span data-sentence-id=\"576#2:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>You make what you defend against, and by your own defense against it is it real and inescapable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#2:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Lay down your arms, and only then do you perceive it false.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>It seems to be the enemy without that you attack.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet your defense sets up an enemy within; an alien thought at war with you, depriving you of peace, splitting your mind into two camps which seem wholly irreconcilable.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For love now has an “enemy,” an opposite; and fear, the alien, now needs your defense against the threat of what you really are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>If you consider carefully the means by which your fancied self-defense proceeds on its imagined way, you will perceive the premises on which the idea stands.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>First, it is obvious ideas must leave their source, for it is you who make attack, and must have first conceived of it.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet you attack outside yourself, and separate your mind from him who is to be attacked, with perfect faith the split you made is real.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Next, are the attributes of love bestowed upon its “enemy.”</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For fear becomes your safety and protector of your peace, to which you turn for solace and escape from doubts about your strength, and hope of rest in dreamless quiet.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And as love is shorn of what belongs to it and it alone, love is endowed with attributes of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>For love would ask you lay down all defense as merely foolish.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And your arms indeed would crumble into dust.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#5:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For such they are.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>With love as enemy, must cruelty become a god.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>And gods demand that those who worship them obey their dictates, and refuse to question them.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Harsh punishment is meted out relentlessly to those who ask if the demands are sensible or even sane.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is their enemies who are unreasonable and insane, while they are always merciful and just.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today we

safety have no guardian, no strength to call upon in danger, and no mighty warrior to fight for them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span

can also be the time of your release from abject slavery.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You make a choice, standing before this idol, seeing him exactly as he is.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Will you restore to love what you have sought to wrest from it and lay before this mindless piece of stone?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Or will you make another idol to replace it?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#8:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>For the god of cruelty takes many forms.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#8:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>Another can be found.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Yet do not think that fear is the escape from fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let us remember what the text has stressed about the obstacles to peace.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>The final one, the hardest to believe is nothing, and a seeming obstacle with the appearance of a solid block, impenetrable, fearful and beyond surmounting, is the fear of God Himself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Here is the basic premise which enthrones the thought of fear as god.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For fear is loved by those who worship it, and love appears to be invested now with cruelty.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Where does the totally insane belief in gods of vengeance come from?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Love has not confused its attributes with those of fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet must the worshippers of fear perceive their own confusion in fear’s “enemy”; its cruelty as now a part of love.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And what becomes more fearful than the Heart of Love Itself?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The blood appears to be upon His Lips; the fire comes from Him.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#10:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And He is terrible above all else, cruel beyond conception, striking down all who acknowledge Him to be their God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The choice you make today is certain.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For you look for the last time upon this bit of carven stone you made, and call it god no longer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You have reached this place before, but you have chosen that this cruel god remain with you in still another form.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And so the fear of God returned with you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>This time you leave it there.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And you return to a new world, unburdened by its weight; beheld not in its sightless eyes, but in the vision that your choice restored to you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"576#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#12:1\"><span class=\"snr

His.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And now your heart remains at peace forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You have chosen Him in place of idols, and your attributes, given by your Creator, are restored to you at last.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>The Call for God is heard and answered.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"576#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Now has fear made way for love, as God Himself replaces cruelty.</span></p></div> <div

data-sentence-id=\"604#1:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>You will not attack yourself, and you will realize that to attack another is but to attack yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#1:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will be free of the insane belief that to attack a brother saves yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#1:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you will understand his safety is your own, and in his healing you are healed.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#2\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">2.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#2:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Perhaps at first you will not understand how mercy, limitless and with all things held in its sure protection, can be found in the idea we practice for today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#2:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>It may, in fact, appear to be a sign that punishment can never be escaped because the ego, under what it sees as threat, is quick to cite the truth to save its lies.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#2:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet must it fail to understand the truth it uses thus.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#2:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>But you can learn to see these foolish applications, and deny the meaning they appear to have.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#3\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">3.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#3:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Thus do you also teach your mind that you are not an ego.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#3:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>For the ways in which the ego would distort the truth will not deceive you longer.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#3:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>You will not believe you are a body to be crucified.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#3:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you will see within today’s idea the light of resurrection, looking past all thoughts of crucifixion and of death, to thoughts of liberation and of life.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#4\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">4.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#4:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Today’s idea is one step we take in leading us from bondage to the state of perfect freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#4:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Let us take this step today, that we may quickly go the way salvation shows us, taking every step in its appointed sequence, as the mind relinquishes its burdens one by one.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#4:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>It is not time we need for this.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#4:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It is but willingness.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#4:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>For what would seem to need a thousand years can easily be done in just one instant by the grace of God.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#5\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">5.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#5:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>The dreary, hopeless thought that you can make attacks on others and escape yourself has nailed you to the cross.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#5:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Perhaps it seemed to be salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#5:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Yet it merely stood for the belief the fear of God is real.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#5:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And what is that but hell?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#5:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Who could believe his Father is his deadly enemy, separate from him, and waiting to destroy his life and blot him from the universe, without the fear of hell upon his heart?</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#6\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">6.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#6:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Such is the form of madness you believe, if you accept the fearful thought you can attack another and be free yourself.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#6:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Until this form is changed, there is no hope.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#6:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Until you see that this, at least, must be entirely impossible, how could there be escape?</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#6:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The fear of God is real to anyone who thinks this thought is true.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#6:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And he will not perceive its foolishness, or even see that it is there, so that it would be possible to question it.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#7\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">7.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#7:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>To question it at all, its form must first be changed at least as much as will permit fear of retaliation to abate, and the responsibility returned to some extent to you.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#7:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>From there you can at least consider if you want to go along this painful path.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#7:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Until this shift has been accomplished, you can not perceive that it is but your thoughts that bring you fear, and your deliverance depends on you.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#8\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">8.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#8:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Our next steps will be easy, if you take this one today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#8:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>From there we go ahead quite rapidly.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#8:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For once you understand it is impossible that you be hurt except by your own thoughts, the fear of God must disappear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#8:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>You cannot then believe that fear is caused without.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#8:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And God, Whom you had thought to banish, can be welcomed back within the holy mind He never left.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#9\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">9.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#9:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Salvation’s song can certainly be heard in the idea we practice for today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#9:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>If it can but be you you crucify, you did not hurt the world, and need not fear its vengeance and pursuit.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#9:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>Nor need you hide in terror from the deadly fear of God projection hides behind.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#9:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>The thing you dread the most is your salvation.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#9:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>You are strong, and it is strength you want.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#9:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>And you are free, and glad of freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#9:7\"><span class=\"snr\">7</span>You have sought to be both weak and bound, because you feared your strength and freedom.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#9:8\"><span class=\"snr\">8</span>Yet salvation lies in them.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#10\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">10.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#10:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is an instant in which terror seems to grip your mind so wholly that escape appears quite hopeless.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#10:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When you realize, once and for all, that it is you you fear, the mind perceives itself as split.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#10:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>And this had been concealed while you believed attack could be directed outward, and returned from outside to within.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#10:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>It seemed to be an enemy outside you had to fear.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#10:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>And thus a god outside yourself became your mortal enemy; the source of fear.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#11\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">11.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#11:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>Now, for an instant, is a murderer perceived within you, eager for your death, intent on plotting punishment for you until the time when it can kill at last.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#11:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>Yet in this instant is the time as well in which salvation comes.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#11:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>For fear of God has disappeared.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#11:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>And you can call on Him to save you from illusions by His Love, calling Him Father and yourself His Son.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#11:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>Pray that the instant may be soon,—today.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#11:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Step back from fear, and make advance to love.</span></p></div> <div data-paragraph-id=\"604#12\"><p class=\"p-normal\"><span class=\"pnr\">12.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#12:1\"><span class=\"snr noprint\">1</span>There is no Thought of God that does not go with you to help you reach that instant, and to go beyond it quickly, surely and forever.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#12:2\"><span class=\"snr\">2</span>When the fear of God is gone, there are no obstacles that still remain between you and the holy peace of God.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#12:3\"><span class=\"snr\">3</span>How kind and merciful is the idea we practice!</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#12:4\"><span class=\"snr\">4</span>Give it welcome, as you should, for it is your release.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#12:5\"><span class=\"snr\">5</span>It is indeed but you your mind can try to crucify.</span> <span data-sentence-id=\"604#12:6\"><span class=\"snr\">6</span>Yet your redemption, too, will come from you.</span></p></div> </div>",
